        <h2>Here's a timeline of Marie Curie's life:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1867</strong> - Born on November 7 in Warsaw, Poland as Maria Sklodowska.</li>
            <li><strong>1891</strong> - Moves to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, overcoming financial struggles.</li>
            <li><strong>1894</strong> - Meets Pierre Curie and marries him in 1895, forming a scientific partnership.</li>
            <li><strong>1898</strong> - Discovers the elements radium and polonium, pioneering the field of radioactivity.</li>
            <li><strong>1903</strong> - Wins the Nobel Prize in Physics (shared with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel) for her discovery of radioactivity.</li>
            <li><strong>1906</strong> - Pierre Curie tragically dies; Marie becomes the first woman professor at Sorbonne University.</li>
            <li><strong>1911</strong> - Wins the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work on radioactive elements, becoming the first person to win two Nobel Prizes in different fields.</li>
            <li><strong>1914-1918</strong> - Contributes to World War I efforts by equipping ambulances with portable X-ray machines ("Little Curies").</li>
            <li><strong>1934</strong> - Passes away on July 4 due to complications from long-term exposure to radiation.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Legacy:</h2>
        <p>Marie Curie’s research laid the foundation for radiation therapies still used in cancer treatments today. In 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed in the Panthéon in Paris on her own merits, cementing her place among France’s most distinguished individuals.</p>
    
        <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
        <p>Marie Curie refused to patent the process for isolating radium, believing that scientific knowledge should be shared freely for the benefit of humanity.</p>
       <h2>Comments from Great Minds:</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>"Marie Curie is, of all celebrated beings, the only one whom fame has not corrupted." – Albert Einstein</em></p>
            <p><em>"Her strength lies in her persistence, and her legacy is a triumph for all of humanity." – Winston Churchill</em></p>
            <p><em>"In science, we must be interested in things, not in persons. But Marie Curie’s personality shines so bright that it almost outshines her discoveries." – Niels Bohr</em></p>
